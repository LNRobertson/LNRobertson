### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I've spent my career in operations and strategic planning. While managing P&Ls, I naturally gravitated toward predictive analytics and data science. I've loved the power of data since my first SQL course as an undergrad. I followed my passion for ML/AI to satisfy that constant need to learn and solve complex problems. I now consult businesses on Data and AI Strategy, organize meetups in the open source, and co-founded a community for data professionals. I'm also currently a graduate student in the MSAI program at Dakakta State University. Data and AI are my life. 

- :sparkles: See my [Customer Attrition Prediction](https://github.com/LNRobertson/Customer_Segmentation.git) project, where I used clustering segmentation and classification on a dataset with 3 years of customer behavior data. 
- :beers: Checkout my [Beer Ratings Prediction](https://github.com/LNRobertson/Beer-Rating-Prediction.git) repo, where I used Hierarchical Clustering and Linear Regression on a dataset from Beeradvocate.com 

- :books: I work with Python, SQL, and Tableau (or whatever tool is needed to get the job done!)
- :bulb: I'm adept at translating business challenges into data-driven solutions and driving value in projects
