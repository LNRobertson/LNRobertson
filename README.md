### Hi there 👋 

I’m currently a Director of Ops & Data Science for an M&A firm and the Leadership Fellow for the Women Who Code Data Science Track. Last year, I completed a :mortar_board:  Data Science Career Track certification with Springboard.

I've spent my career in business management, strategic planning, and digital marketing. However, I gravitated towards technology and data since my first SQL course in undergrad. I knew I had to follow my passion for predictive modeling and Machine Learning to satisfy my constant need to learn and solve difficult problems. I see it as the work of the modern-day sage. :crystal_ball: The potential is limitless! 

- :sparkles: See my [Customer Attrition Prediction](https://github.com/LNRobertson/Customer_Segmentation.git) project where I used clustering segmentation and classification on a dataset with 3 years of customer behavior data. 
- :beers: Checkout my [Beer Ratings Prediction](https://github.com/LNRobertson/Beer-Rating-Prediction.git) repo where I used Hierarchical Clustering and Linear Regression on a dataset from Beeradvocate.com 

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate or volunteer on projects for social good. 
- :books: I work with Python, SQL, and Tableau (or whatever tool is needed to get the job done!)
- :bulb: I'm adept at defining business problems with data solutions, communicating at all technical levels, and galvanizing insights across disciplines.
